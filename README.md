# Anatomy of a Rails Application
### March 5th, 2013, [Ruby on Rails for Beginners Meetup](http://www.rails.mn)

## Introduction
This repository and discussions from tonight are heavily based around the work done by Daniel Dekoe. For license information and further, more in-depth content please visit [the original repo](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup). 

Tonight, [Derek Rockwell](http://www.derekrockwell.com), [Weston Platter](http://www.twitter.com/westonplatter) and [Daniel Kent](http://www.twitter.com/thatdankent) will take you through the setup of this basic 'pre-launch' website built on Ruby on Rails. Our goals are to teach you:
* How to copy this codebase to your machine
* How to configure your code to be able to deploy to your machine
* A high-level overview of the structure of a Ruby on Rails application and how it works top to bottom
* How to add a simple feature
* Some tips and best practices for developing in Rails
* (Time permitting) configure your application to deploy to Heroku and be internet accessible

If at any point during the session you would like some clarification, don't hesitate to ask questions.

## Before you start
Make sure you have:
* Ruby 1.9.3 (with RVM or otherwise)
* Ruby on Rails 3.2
* Git and a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup/free) account

If you do not have any of these please contact one of the organizers to help you get started.

A good resource for installing a Rails environment on your own can be found [here](http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html)
